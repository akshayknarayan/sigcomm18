\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:concl}

We described the design, implementation, and evaluation of CCP, a system that restructures congestion control at the sender. CCP defines better abstractions for congestion control, specifying the responsibilities of the datapath and showing a way to use fold functions and control patterns to exercise control over datapath behavior. We showed how CCP (i) enables the same algorithm code to run on a variety of datapaths, (ii) increases the ``velocity'' of development and improves maintainability, and (iii) facilitates new capabilities such as the congestion manager-style aggregation and sophisticated signal processing algorithms. 

Our implementation achieves high fidelity compared to native datapath implementations at low CPU overhead. The use of fold functions and summarization reduces overhead, but not at the expense of correctness or accuracy.
We additionally showed multiple use cases of CCP, including in Park (\S\ref{s:capabilities:park}) and Bundler (\S\ref{s:capabilities:bundler}).
