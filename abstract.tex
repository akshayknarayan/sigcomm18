\begin{abstract}

This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a Congestion Control Plane (CCP), a new way to structure congestion control functions at the sender by removing them from the datapath. With CCP, each datapath---such as the Linux Kernel TCP, UDP-based QUIC, or kernel-bypass transports like mTCP-on-DPDK---summarizes information about the round-trip times, packet receptions, losses, ECN, etc. via a well-defined interface to congestion-control algorithms running in CCP. The algorithms use this information to control the datapath's congestion window or pacing rate. We show that CCP enables, for the first time, congestion control algorithms to be written once and run on multiple datapaths. CCP improves both the pace of development and ease of maintenance of congestion control algorithms by providing better, modular abstractions, and enables new capabilities such as aggregate congestion control across groups of connections, all with one-time changes to datapaths. Experiments with our user-level Linux CCP implementation show that CCP algorithms behave similarly to kernel algorithms, and incur modest CPU overhead of a few percent. CCP enables new capabilities, such as Copa in Linux TCP, several algorithms for the first time on QUIC and mTCP/DPDK, and the use of signal processing algorithms to detect whether cross-traffic is ACK-clocked or not.
